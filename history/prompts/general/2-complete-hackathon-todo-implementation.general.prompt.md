# Prompt
```
✅ FINAL SPEC SET (PHASE II + III)

WITH STRICT UI/UX + TAILWIND ENFORCEMENT

📁 /specs/overview.md (UPDATED)
# Todo App – Evolution of Todo

## Purpose
A spec-driven Todo application evolving from a full-stack web app into an AI-powered conversational system with a polished, production-grade UI.

## Active Phases
- Phase II: Full-Stack Web Application
- Phase III: AI-Powered Todo Chatbot

## Development Rules
- Strict Spec-Driven Development using Spec-Kit Plus
- No manual code writing by the user
- All implementation generated by Claude Code
- UI/UX quality is a first-class requirement

## Tech Stack
Frontend:
- Next.js 16 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS (PostCSS-based)
- Better Auth
- OpenAI ChatKit

Backend:
- FastAPI
- SQLModel
- Neon PostgreSQL
- OpenAI Agents SDK
- Official MCP SDK

## Styling Rules (MANDATORY)
- Tailwind CSS must be correctly configured via PostCSS
- CSS must only be imported in `app/layout.tsx`
- All custom styles must live in `globals.css`

📁 /specs/architecture.md (UPDATED)
# System Architecture

## Architecture Style
- Stateless REST APIs
- Stateless AI agent execution
- Database-backed persistence
- MCP tool-based AI interactions

## Frontend Architecture
- Next.js App Router
- Server Components by default
- Client Components explicitly marked
- Centralized styling via Tailwind + globals.css

## Backend Architecture
- FastAPI REST services
- MCP server for task tools
- JWT authentication enforced

## Scalability
- Horizontal scaling supported
- Stateless backend
- Database as single source of truth

## Security
- JWT verification middleware
- User isolation at query layer

📁 /specs/features/task-crud.md
# Feature: Task CRUD

## User Stories
- User can create, update, delete tasks
- User can mark tasks as complete
- User can view their own tasks only

## Acceptance Criteria
- All actions require JWT authentication
- Tasks are user-scoped
- UI reflects changes instantly
- Errors are displayed clearly

## UX Requirements
- Inline editing for title/description
- Completed tasks visually muted
- Delete requires confirmation modal

📁 /specs/features/authentication.md
# Feature: Authentication

## Auth Provider
Better Auth (JWT-based)

## Flow
1. User registers
2. User logs in
3. JWT issued
4. JWT attached to all API requests

## UX Requirements
- Clean minimal forms
- Inline validation
- Loading and error states

📁 /specs/features/chatbot.md
# Feature: AI Todo Chatbot

## Description
Natural language interface to manage todos using MCP tools.

## Agent Rules
- Always use MCP tools
- Never hallucinate task state
- Confirm all actions
- Respond concisely and politely

## UX Requirements
- Chat UI similar to modern AI products
- Clear role distinction
- Tool actions summarized

📁 /specs/api/rest-endpoints.md
# REST API Endpoints

## Authentication
Authorization: Bearer <JWT>

## Endpoints
- GET /api/{user_id}/tasks
- POST /api/{user_id}/tasks
- PUT /api/{user_id}/tasks/{id}
- DELETE /api/{user_id}/tasks/{id}
- PATCH /api/{user_id}/tasks/{id}/complete

## Rules
- user_id must match JWT
- Proper HTTP status codes

📁 /specs/api/mcp-tools.md
# MCP Tools

## add_task
Params: user_id, title, description?
Returns: task_id, status

## list_tasks
Params: user_id, status?
Returns: tasks[]

## update_task
Params: user_id, task_id, title?, description?
Returns: status

## complete_task
Params: user_id, task_id
Returns: status

## delete_task
Params: user_id, task_id
Returns: status

📁 /specs/database/schema.md
# Database Schema

## tasks
- id (pk)
- user_id (indexed)
- title
- description
- completed
- created_at
- updated_at

## conversations
- id
- user_id
- created_at

## messages
- id
- conversation_id
- role
- content
- created_at

📁 /specs/ui/styling.md ⭐ NEW – IMPORTANT
# UI Styling & Tailwind Enforcement Spec

## Tailwind Configuration (MANDATORY)
Claude Code MUST:

1. Create `postcss.config.js` with Tailwind plugin enabled
2. Configure `tailwind.config.ts` correctly
3. Ensure `content` paths include:
   - app/**
   - components/**
   - lib/**
   - frontend/**

## CSS Import Rules
- Tailwind CSS must be imported ONLY in `app/layout.tsx`
- No CSS imports in components or pages

## globals.css Rules
- All custom CSS classes must be defined in `globals.css`
- No inline styles
- No style tags inside components

## Cache Handling
- If styling issues occur, clear `.next` cache
- Restart dev server after CSS changes

## Client Components
- Components requiring:
  - dynamic classes
  - interactivity
  - animations
must include `"use client"`

## Validation
- If Tailwind styles do not apply, configuration must be fixed before proceeding

📁 /specs/ui/components.md
# UI Components

## Components
- Navbar
- Sidebar
- TaskCard
- TaskForm
- FilterBar
- ChatPanel
- MessageBubble

## Design System
- Tailwind CSS utilities
- Neutral gray base
- Primary accent: Indigo/Blue
- Rounded corners
- Subtle shadows

## Interaction
- Hover states
- Disabled states
- Keyboard accessibility

📁 /specs/ui/pages.md
# UI Pages

## /login
- Centered card
- Email/password
- Error + loading states

## /register
- Same layout as login

## /dashboard
Layout:
- Left: Task management
- Right: AI Chatbot

## Mobile
- Responsive layout
- Chat collapsible

🧠 FINAL CLAUDE CLI COMMAND (USE THIS)
Implement Phase II and Phase III strictly according to all specs in /specs.
Follow CLAUDE.md and Spec-Kit Plus conventions.
UI/UX and Tailwind styling rules in specs/ui/styling.md are mandatory.
Do not proceed if Tailwind is misconfigured.
```
